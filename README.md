# Geofence Server in Ruby (a simple example)

This is a simple example project to showcase geofencing with Ruby and Mongo.
There is a full write-up that can be found on [my blog][1]. 


## Getting Started
FIXME: add information for how to start the server with example curl commands
       and all that hoo-haa. 

## Exploring with the Console
Once you've played around with the project's web server, you might want to take
a look at the code. It's rather simple and could serve as a good starting point
for you. If you really want to get hands one with the application you can start
up the interactive console:

    ./console.rb

Make sure you have ran `bundle` to install all the gems for this project.
